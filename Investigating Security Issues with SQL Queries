# Investigating Security Issues with SQL Queries

Project Overview:

In this project, I assume the role of a security professional tasked with investigating potential security issues within an organization. The focus is on analyzing data related to employee login attempts to detect anomalies and secure the system.

Scenario
As part of a large organizationâ€™s security team, it is my responsibility to ensure that employee machines and login activities are secure. Recently, potential security concerns were identified, specifically related to suspicious login attempts. To investigate, I utilized SQL queries to filter and retrieve relevant records from two key datasets: employees and log_in_attempts. By analyzing these records, I was able to uncover patterns that could indicate unauthorized access or other security threats.

Key Concepts Explored:
SQL Data Retrieval: Leveraging SQL queries to extract and filter data related to employees and their login attempts, helping to identify potential threats.
Security Investigation: Identifying patterns and anomalies in login attempts to assess potential security breaches.
Data Analysis: Applying logical filters and conditions to the datasets to isolate key information that reveals security risks.
This project demonstrates the application of SQL in real-world security investigations, focusing on preventing unauthorized access and safeguarding the organization's data.
