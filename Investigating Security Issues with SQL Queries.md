# 🔍 Investigating Security Issues with SQL Queries 🛡️

## Project Overview: 

Welcome to this project where I step into the shoes of a security professional working for a large organization! 🏢 
My goal? To dive deep into the world of data analysis and cybersecurity 🖥️, uncovering potential threats to the company’s system. 
Let's take a closer look at how I used SQL to solve real-world security problems. 🚨

## 🚨 The Scenario
As a security expert, I was tasked with investigating unusual login activity within the organization. 🔐 
Recent reports flagged suspicious login attempts, raising concerns about unauthorized access. 
To tackle this issue, I used SQL to analyze data from the `employees` and `log_in_attempts` tables. 
By applying precise filters, I could pinpoint patterns that indicated potential security threats. ⚠️

## 💡 What I Did:

**SQL Data Retrieval 🗄️:** Wrote SQL queries to extract records of interest, filtering data from two key tables: `employees` and 
`log_in_attempts`. This allowed me to focus on suspicious behavior.

**Security Investigation 🔍:** Used data analysis to identify unusual patterns in login activity and detect any unauthorized access.

**Protecting Data 🛡️:** By isolating key security risks, I was able to help secure the organization’s systems and prevent future breaches.

## ✨ Key Skills Demonstrated:
**🖥️ SQL Mastery:** Used advanced queries to filter and retrieve critical data efficiently.

**🔍 Data Analysis:** Investigated login trends to identify possible security threats.

**🛡️ Security Best Practices:** Demonstrated the importance of proactive threat detection in protecting sensitive information.

💼 This project showcases the intersection of data analysis and cybersecurity, leveraging SQL as a powerful tool for keeping 
systems secure. By diving into the data, I was able to uncover insights and protect the organization from potential threats. 🎯
